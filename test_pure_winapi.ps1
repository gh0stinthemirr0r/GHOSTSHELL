# Test script for Pure Windows API Executor
# This script tests the new pure Windows API approach to window suppression

Write-Host "This test will demonstrate the new pure Windows API approach that:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  1. Bypasses all existing terminal infrastructure" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  2. Uses direct Windows API process creation" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  3. Applies aggressive window suppression at the OS level" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  4. Monitors and controls windows in real-time" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "Testing commands that typically cause popup windows..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

# Test 1: Basic PowerShell command
Write-Host "Test 1: Basic PowerShell execution" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "Command: Get-Date" -ForegroundColor Gray
# This would be executed via the pure API executor
Write-Host "Expected: No popup windows, clean output" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

# Test 2: Nested PowerShell (problematic)
Write-Host "Test 2: Nested PowerShell (typically shows popup)" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "Command: powershell -Command 'Write-Host Test'" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "Expected: Pure API executor suppresses nested PowerShell window" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

# Test 3: System information command
Write-Host "Test 3: System information (often triggers console)" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "Command: systeminfo | Select-String 'OS Name'" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "Expected: No console window, just output" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

# Test 4: CMD command with timeout
Write-Host "Test 4: CMD with timeout (usually shows CMD window)" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "Command: echo Test && timeout /t 1 /nobreak > nul" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "Expected: Pure API executor hides CMD window completely" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

# Test 5: Process listing
Write-Host "Test 5: Process listing (can trigger multiple windows)" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "Command: Get-Process | Where-Object ProcessName -like '*powershell*'" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "Expected: Clean execution with window suppression count" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "=== Pure Windows API Executor Features ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Key Differences from Standard Approach:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  • Direct CreateProcessW() API calls" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  • Multiple suppression flags: CREATE_NO_WINDOW, DETACHED_PROCESS, etc." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  • Real-time window enumeration and suppression" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  • Process-specific window monitoring" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  • Aggressive cleanup with multiple suppression methods" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  • Pipe-based output capture (no console needed)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Window Suppression Methods Applied:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  1. ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_HIDE) - Complete hiding" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  2. SetWindowPos() to 1x1 pixel off-screen" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  3. ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_MINIMIZE) - Minimize" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  4. Process creation with maximum suppression flags" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  5. Real-time monitoring every 50ms" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "To test this new executor:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  1. Build the application with the new pure_winapi_executor module" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  2. Use the Tauri commands:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "     - pure_test_powershell(command)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "     - pure_test_cmd(command)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "     - pure_comprehensive_test()" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "     - pure_test_problematic_commands()" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "  3. Monitor the windows_suppressed count in results" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Expected Results:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  • Zero visible popup windows during execution" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  • Non-zero windows_suppressed count indicating active suppression" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  • Clean command output without window interference" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  • Fast execution times due to direct API usage" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "=== Test Complete ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "This pure Windows API approach should eliminate popup windows entirely." -ForegroundColor Green
