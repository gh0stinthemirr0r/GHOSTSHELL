# GHOSTSHELL — GhostScript Deep Dive

**Focus:** **Script Management & Execution Engine (Python, Batch, PowerShell)**
*(centralized, policy-aware, neon-themed script execution system inside GhostShell)*

---

## 1) Objectives & Success Criteria

**Objectives**

* Build **GhostScript**, a system for managing, executing, and auditing **Python, Batch (.bat), and PowerShell scripts**.
* Provide a secure **repository of scripts**, stored in **GhostVault** with PQ encryption/signing.
* Enable **execution in sandboxed environments** with controlled privileges.
* Deliver a **GUI management panel** to create, edit, tag, and run scripts.
* Integrate with **GhostLog** for logging executions and **GhostAlign** for compliance posture.
* Allow **parameterized execution**, scheduling, and safe rollback.

**Success Criteria**

* Analysts can upload or write scripts into GhostShell, categorize and tag them.
* Scripts can be executed securely, with **policy enforcement** (e.g., block destructive commands unless privileged).
* All runs generate **signed logs**, with stdout/stderr captured.
* GUI allows **querying past executions**, with exportable results.
* Execution is consistent across Windows/Linux/macOS.

---

## 2) Scope (Phase Delivery)

### Core Functions

* **Script Repository**:

  * Stored in Vault, PQ-encrypted.
  * Metadata: name, description, tags, language, createdBy, modifiedBy, signatures.
* **Execution Engine**:

  * Rust orchestrator spawns scripts in sandbox.
  * Per-language handlers: Python interpreter, PowerShell Core/Windows, CMD shell.
  * Stdout/stderr captured and streamed to UI.
* **Policy Control**:

  * Role-based restrictions (e.g., only admins can run system-impacting scripts).
  * Policy-based whitelisting/blacklisting (deny `rm -rf`, `format`, etc.).
* **Logging**:

  * All executions signed, logged to GhostLog.
  * Captures: who ran it, what parameters, exit code, runtime, system impact.

### GUI Features

* **Scripts Panel**: searchable list of scripts with tags.
* **Editor**: built-in code editor (syntax highlighting for Python/PS/Batch).
* **Execution Console**: run script with params, see live output in neon terminal.
* **Results Archive**: queryable table of past runs with logs.
* **Export/Import**: PQ-signed script bundles.

### Extra Capabilities

* **Scheduling**: recurring execution (daily, weekly).
* **Parameter Injection**: variables passed at runtime with safe substitution.
* **Rollback Scripts**: link a script with a rollback partner.
* **Theming**: cyberpunk neon glow in editor (e.g., Monaco Editor styled with neon accents).

## 3) Architecture

```
crates/
  ghost_script/     # repository, metadata, execution orchestration
  ghost_runner_py/  # python execution sandbox
  ghost_runner_ps/  # powershell sandbox
  ghost_runner_bat/ # batch script sandbox
  ghost_editor/     # syntax highlighting, linting
```

**Flow**

1. User opens GhostScript → browses scripts.
2. Selects or creates new script (editor → save → Vault).
3. Executes script with params → sandbox runner spawns.
4. Stdout/stderr → streamed to UI → saved to GhostLog.
5. Run manifest (metadata + PQ signature) archived for compliance.

---

## 4) Data Models

**Script Metadata**

```json
{
  "id":"script-2025-08-27-001",
  "name":"Rotate DNS Cache",
  "lang":"powershell",
  "tags":["network","maintenance"],
  "createdBy":"analyst01",
  "modifiedBy":"analyst01",
  "created":"2025-08-27T04:20Z",
  "hash":"sha3-...",
  "signature":"dilithium-sig..."
}
```

**Execution Record**

```json
{
  "id":"run-2025-08-27-002",
  "scriptId":"script-2025-08-27-001",
  "executor":"admin02",
  "params":{"target":"corp-dns01"},
  "stdout":"DNS cache flushed successfully",
  "stderr":"",
  "exitCode":0,
  "runtime":"3.2s",
  "timestamp":"2025-08-27T04:22Z",
  "signature":"dilithium-sig..."
}
```

---

## 5) Naming & Storage Conventions

* **Scripts directory in Vault:**

  * `/ghostvault/scripts/<lang>/<name>-<id>.script`
* **Executions:**

  * `/ghostvault/logs/scripts/<lang>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<scriptName>-<runId>.json`

---

## 6) UI / UX

### Sidebar Entry → GhostScript

**Top Section**

* **Script Repository Table**

  * Columns: Name | Language | Tags | Last Modified | Author
  * Search bar (full-text on name/tags).
  * Filter by language/tag.

**Editor**

* Embedded Monaco-style editor with cyberpunk theme:

  * Background: #12131A, 70% acrylic.
  * Syntax neon colors: Pink (keywords), Cyan (functions), Yellow-Green (strings).
  * Cursor: block neon green.
* Save → signs and stores in Vault.

**Execution Console**

* Neon terminal view.
* Live streaming of stdout/stderr with color-coding.
* Buttons: Run, Run w/ Params, Stop.

**Results Archive**

* Queryable glossy table: Run ID, Script Name, Executor, Timestamp, Status.
* Expand → show stdout/stderr, export log.

### Theming

* Neon glow on run success (cyan).
* Amber pulse on warnings.
* Red glow/pulse on errors.
* Exec Mode → flat grey editor, blue highlights.

## 7) Security & Policy

* **Sandbox Execution**:

  * Scripts run under restricted accounts.
  * Resource limits (CPU, memory, network).
* **Policy Enforcement**:

  * Example rule:

```toml
[[rules]]
id = "block-destructive-batch"
resource = "ghostscript.run"
action = "execute"
when = { lang="bat", commandMatch="format" }
effect = "deny"
constraints = { notify="critical" }
```

* **Vault Protection**: scripts & results PQ-signed, encrypted.
* **Audit Trail**: every run, save, or edit logged in GhostLog.

---

## 8) Testing & QA

**Unit**

* Script repository CRUD.
* Runners parse output correctly.
* Sandbox policy enforcement.

**Integration**

* Save script → appears in repo + signed.
* Run Python script → output streams to UI, log written.
* Run disallowed PowerShell cmd → blocked with policy violation toast.

**Security**

* Tampered script file → signature mismatch, cannot run.
* Attempt to bypass policy → denied, logged.

**Performance**

* Executes scripts within <200ms spawn overhead.
* Handles 100 concurrent runs.

---

## 9) Timeline (4–5 weeks)

**Week 1:** Repository + metadata; Vault integration.
**Week 2:** Execution engine + runners for Python, PS, Batch.
**Week 3:** Editor + Execution Console UI.
**Week 4:** Results archive + search/export.
**Week 5 (buffer):** Policy hooks, GhostLog integration, QA.

---

## 10) Deliverables

* **GhostScript v1**: script repo, execution engine, GUI.
* **Editor** with neon syntax highlighting.
* **Execution Console** with live output.
* **Results Archive** with searchable logs.
* **PQ-signed exports** of scripts + runs.
* **Policy enforcement** (sandbox, whitelists/blacklists).
* **GhostLog integration**: every run signed + stored.

---

## 11) Future Expansion

* Add support for **Bash, Ruby, Go snippets**.
* **Script Marketplace**: share PQ-signed scripts between teams.
* **AI integration** (Phase 13): suggest fixes for failed scripts, generate code snippets.
* **Scheduled Workflows**: chain scripts + conditional execution.
* **Real-time metrics**: runtime performance chart per script.
